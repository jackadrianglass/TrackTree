# All the ideas

What is the tool for?

- Make learning an instrument easier
- Make transitioning from practice, to idea, to writting your own stuff easier
- Make improvisation & composition a big part of the process
- Make progress visible

Aspects of learning an instrument
- Physical ability (are you even able to do the thing?)
    - Speed
    - Dynamics
    - On drums
        - Coordination
        - Independence & interdependence
        - Stickings and patterns
    - On guitar
        - Chord shapes
        - Scales & runs
        - Picking & strumming patterns
- Rhythm (can you play in time? can you play the same idea in different contexts? can you hear the rhythm?)
    - Literal timing practice
    - Rhythmic phrasing
- Theory & context (can you play in different keys? different styles?)
    - What things work together?
    - How do things relate to each other?
    - Theory is just at framework to understand ideas
- Vocabulary
    - What ideas do you have?
    - Taking the letters and making them words
- Improv
    - How to mix ideas together
    - Structure music from phrases & paragraphs rather than letters & words

What do I struggle with?
- Knowing what to practice
- Feeling proud of my progress. Progress is almost invisible
- How to go from scales to making music
- How to "just play with a scale and come up with something"

What helps?
- Make progress visible
    - Check points, recordings, compositions
    - Reminders to actually make those recordings
- Make loose structure around practice
    - ABC method
    - Routines
    - Make prioritization easy
    - Tools are easy and accessible right next to the plan
- Make writting and manipulation of ideas easy
    - Groovescribe -> Makes writting basic drum tracks easy
    - Tabscribe (guitar equivalent?) -> Make writting guitar ideas easy
    - JP improv games -> vocabulary integration with other ideas
    - Ideas as blocks with variations (tools around creating and combining blocks)
    - Easy permutation, polyrhythm, and displacement (A= B=, language of drumming, layering of ideas)
- Backing track maker
    - Make your own backing tracks easily. Kind of a programatic looping pedal
    - Random silence (gap click -> highlight timing)
    - Common chord progressions provided
    - Common drum ideas provided
    - Groove/tabscribe integrated?
    - MIDI controllable?
- Practice contextualization around songs
    - Practice is transposed in the context of a song
    - Key, speed, rhythmic ideas
- Song practice tools
    - Transcription tools
    - Song speed manipulation tools (slow down songs, loop specific parts, pause and play)
    - Extract idea blocks from songs
- Integration with lessons and content
    - (Potential for making money here without directly charging users)
    - External parties can embed tools in their lessons
- Teacher & students
    - How to facilitate teachers educating students?

    - Teachers sharing curriculums with each other?

UI
- What makes someone want to pick up the app?
- How do we present enough functionality without it being overwhelming?
- How do we give tools to quickly write out ideas?

What seems like way too much work?
- Coming up with the curriculums and learning paths
- Audio processing (though I'd love to try)
